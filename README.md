##DiffusedSplitFed

This is the code repository of the paper: "DiffusedSplitFed: When Latent Diffusion and global feature fusion meet Split Federated medical image segmentation"

**DiffusedSplitFed** is a novel privacy-preserving Split Federated Learning (SplitFed) framework that incorporates **Latent Denoising Diffusion Models (LDDMs)** at the client-server split points to obfuscate intermediate feature and gradient representations during training.

Our approach is the **first** to explore latent diffusion-based obfuscation in SplitFed networks, enabling a practical balance between **privacy preservation** and **segmentation performance** in sensitive domains like medical imaging.
